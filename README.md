### Concept:

#### Assumptions:

PCA is based on the Pearson correlation coefficient framework and inherits similar assumptions.
* Sample size: Minimum of 150 observations and ideally a 5:1 ratio of observation to features (Pallant, 2010)
* Correlations: The feature set is correlated, so the reduced feature set effectively represents the original data space.
* Linearity: All variables exhibit a constant multivariate normal relationship, and principal components are a linear combination of the original features.
* Outliers: No significant outliers in the data as these can have a disproportionate influence on the results.
* Large variance implies more structure: high variance axes are treated as principal components, while low variance axes are treated as noise and discarded.
